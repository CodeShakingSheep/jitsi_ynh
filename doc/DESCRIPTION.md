Jitsi Meet is a libre software (Apache) WebRTC JavaScript app that uses Jitsi Videobridge to provide high quality, secure, and scalable video conferences.

## Disclaimer

**Jitsi** for YunoHost for now as some limitations:
  * Can only be used using Chrome/Chromium
  * Is limited to two participants

Those limitations come from the packaging of the upstream app. Have to be improved.
